# Project Task Manager
This project was designed in one week as a final project for my Nology course. I had to practice developing full stack project from scratch. The project has 2 repositories, one for backend and the other for frontend. Frontend part is created with React, Chakra and Formic react libraries. an API and backend developed using Spring Boot, mySQL Workbench for creating database. It is a to do list application what allows a user to store lists of tasks. 


## Motivation
The purpose of this project to bring together everything I learnt in a 12 week of Full Stack Development course at Nology.


## Build Status
Basic CRUD for lists and task lists is done for both backend and frontend. I am planning to add archive and unarchive functionality, tick icon for tasks that are done. Add ability to store lists of items with relevant pictures(e.g. Shopping list items) in arrays for automatic suggestions when the user starts typing it in. Add theme colors choice for lists. Make layout responsive to the screen size. Add Autentification.
